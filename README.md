One-on-Ones
====

One-on-One meetings are important and they are your meeting. We will have a shared document for our one-on-ones that you can add status or agenda items to. I will as well. We will cover what you want to talk about first. Ideally, this is more than just a status meeting but rather something to dig deeper into what has been going on and any upcoming challenges you forsee.

I'll have my items to check-in on as well. I should frequently ask you for anything I can do to help or any feedback you have for me.

If there's a day we're scheduled and you just don't have anything to talk about or you're really squeezed to get some work done and could utilize our one-on-one time for that, reach out to me and suggest we skip.

Feedback to Me

Details to come.

My Calendar
====
I do my absolute best to keep my Outlook calendar up to date. If something shows up as tentative then you can probably schedule over it because I haven't committed to it (feel free to check first). If I have items showing I'm out of the office then yep I am out of the office. Sometimes I have to come in late or leave early.

I do my best to not schedule early meetings unless I know everyone on the list are early arrivers.

I do my best to not schedule lunch meetings because some people are like me and use lunch to recharge for the rest of the day.

And yes, you do lose some credibility points with me if you schedule a lunch meeting with my team members without re-ensuring us how important it is and swearing it will be a rare ask. In what I've seen in my career, lunch meetings are usually fall-out from poor planning and scrambling to cover ground.

The More You Know : I'm an Introvert
====

I do enjoy talking to you and other folks, it is just that I'm wired to consume energy when I'm with people. I have to go off and be by myself with my own thoughts for a while to recharge. So sometimes you'll see me bugging out early for lunch or for an afternoon walk for coffee.

The More You Know : I'm an INTJ
====

If you're into personality types, I test for INTJ. Thank you, Dr. Jung. By the way, Bruce Toggnazzini has a great article called "*Carl Jung and the Macintosh*" which I highly recommend.

Important Concept To Me : Situational Leadership II
====

One of the most interesting classes I took at Microsoft was *Situational Leadership II* (There was no I). An important take-away from that class was the concept of judging someone's capability by each task they have, not the whole person. The breakout of looking at a person and the assigned tasks are:

1. Enthusiastic Beginning
2. Disillusioned Learner
3. Competent Practioner
4. Expert

It's a two-way conversation. So when you have a new task, I'll do my best to ensure I'm working with you on what I believe your correct level is for that task. It's on you, too, to let me know if you feel like you're disillusioned on something while I'm treating you like you're competent and able to run with it yourself.

Important Concept To Me : Harmonious Initiative
====

One of my former manager and coworkers, Mark Flick, shared the great concept of Harmonious Initiative. I love it. It is ensuring that everyone knows what the current priorities and tasks are that everyone should be focused on. At the end of the day, this level of constantly communicated focus and priority allow everyone to make good decisions about what to do, what order to do them in, and what not to do.

One way to tell this is done well: when the manager or leader is gone for a couple of weeks and everything goes smoothly because everyone is in sync.

The paper "*Are We Ready to be Unleashed? A Comparative Analysis between Agile Software Development and War Fighting*" by Steve Adolph is a great summary.
